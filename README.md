## Purpose of Challenge:

This project utlize MySQL, Sequelize a Promised-based Node.js ORM, Visual Studio and Insomnia to teach us solid beck-end user transaction support for an e-commerce database. The purpose of this project was to show us how to see the database using MySQL then use Sequilize to seed the database in a back-end server. From there I was able to view, modify or delete products, tags and categories for the e-commerce database. With the ORM application we were allowed to create virtual object databases that were used within the code while managing relational databases. We used Javascript to setup the objects and let Sequelize translate the code into database schema and queries using SQL. Finally, all routes for the project were tested in Insomnia. All products, tags and categories were tested with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE using JSON language to render the results while listening on Port 3001.

## Resources That Were Utilized For This Challnege:

1. Visual Studio
2. MySQL2
3. Dotenv
4. Javascript
5. Insomnia
6. JSON
