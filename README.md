# ORM E-Commerce Site

# Purpose of Challenge

This project utlize MySQL, Sequelize a Promised-based Node.js ORM, Visual Studio and Insomnia to teach us solid beck-end user transaction support for an e-commerce database. The purpose of this project was to show us how to see the database using MySQL then make queries using Sequilize to view, alter or delete products from an e-commerce database. With the ORM application we were allowed to create virtual object databases that were used within the coee while managin relational databases. We used Javascript to setup the objects and let Sequelize translate the code into database schema and queries using SQL. Finally, all routes for the project were tested in Insomnia. All products, tags and categories were tested with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE using JSON language to render the results while listening on Port 3001.
